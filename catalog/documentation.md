## Manual Deployment

```bash
# Typically you will need to regenerate the uuid for the account to which you're deploying this app, use the following command
nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf [--profile=your_profile_name]
# to see a list of APIkeys / profiles available in your development environment, run nr1 credentials:list
# after regenerating your uuid publish to your account
nr1 nerdpack:publish [--profile=your_profile_name]
```

## Getting started


1. Ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed. If you're unsure whether you have one or both of them installed, run the following commands. (If you have them installed, these commands return a version number; if not, the commands aren't recognized.)
```bash
git --version
npm -v
```
2. Install the [NR1 CLI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher) by going to [the developer center](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher), and following the instructions to install and set up your New Relic development environment. This should take about 5 minutes.
3. Execute the following command to clone this repository and run the code locally against your New Relic data:

```bash
nr1 nerdpack:clone -r https://github.com/newrelic/nr-labs-widget-pack.git
cd nr-labs-widget-pack
nr1 nerdpack:serve
```
